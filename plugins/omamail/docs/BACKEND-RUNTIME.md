# Backend runtimes and releases

## Omarchy plugin-owned backend

Omarchy's Plugin Marketplace owns the checkout and its UI. Omamail keeps exactly
one executable at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/omamail/bin/omamail`. Keeping
the mutable runtime outside the recursively watched plugin tree prevents an
installation or CLI operation from reloading the interface. The root `backend-version`
file requires an exact version, independent of PATH and system packages. Service
starts one persistent `omamail serve` process over stdin/stdout and checks its
exact binary version, protocol and API revision before dispatching migrated calls.
The plugin-local `backend-api.json` describes its required API; it is not fetched
from main or from a latest-release endpoint.

On a missing or mismatched runtime, the UI explains what is needed. Installation
is explicit; simply loading the plugin never starts a download. From the plugin
directory, `scripts/install-backend.sh` requests the same installation and
`python3 scripts/backend-runtime.py status` reports local state without network
access. Linux x86_64 and aarch64 are supported. Installation downloads only from
the pinned release in `huacnlee/omamail`, verifies SHA256SUMS and the strict archive
layout, checks the candidate executable's version and atomically replaces the
old executable. A failed installation preserves the working runtime. Checksums
protect integrity, not against a compromised publisher.

`python3 scripts/backend-runtime.py enable-cli` explicitly creates
`~/.local/bin/omamail` as a symlink to that same private executable; it refuses
an unrelated file or link. An owned link into a previous Omamail plugin checkout's
runtime is repointed without modifying that watched directory. Nothing edits PATH. Run `disable-cli` before removing
the plugin, since Omarchy has no verified uninstall hook for that external link.
`scripts/uninstall-backend.sh` removes the runtime only. Neither operation deletes
accounts, drafts, caches or keyring entries. Marketplace checkouts contain no
symlinks; the optional CLI link is outside the checkout.

For development, `./dev backend` builds the binary and `./dev run` builds then
prints environment and launch instructions. It does not open or restart the
shell. `OMAMAIL_BIN` is an explicit development
path; the installer must never replace that file. Environment changes in your
terminal do not change an already running shell: follow the printed instructions
to make the override available when the shell constructs the plugin, restarting
the shell with that environment when needed. This is not a second Quickshell
application. Rust mail migration remains incomplete; see [BACKEND.md](BACKEND.md).

## Standalone bundled backend

The standalone Qt host under `app/` uses the same `ui/` composition and Rust business modules through small Quickshell compatibility adapters. A production archive places one exact-version `omamail` backend beside `omamail-app`, together with the QML, manifest, Qt libraries, and platform plugin. Production resource lookup accepts that bundled backend only; it does not search PATH, resolve `latest`, or use `OMAMAIL_BIN`. The environment override and source-resource lookup are enabled only when `OMAMAIL_DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES=1`, which is what `make app-run` sets for a checkout build.

The host starts one persistent bundled `omamail serve` process and performs the protocol, version, and API handshake before mail or calendar calls. Normal shutdown asks the service to quit, drains bounded output, and then terminates the process tree on deadline. `omamail-app --check-resources` verifies the packaged entry points, platform plugin, manifest version, backend architecture, and backend version without opening the UI. `omamail-app --smoke-test READY_FILE` additionally starts the bundled backend, completes the handshake, requests shutdown, and writes readiness metadata only after a clean exit.

Standalone credentials use the native store through typed backend RPC: Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on Linux, and Credential Manager on Windows. Account metadata, cache, state, runtime endpoints, and downloads use the platform directories selected by `src/platform/dirs.rs`; private files and outbox IPC are protected by the platform implementations under `src/platform/`. The host never places a secret in its process arguments. The standalone capability object disables AI, the tray, and operating-system `mailto:` registration while retaining native notifications.

For source development, `make app-build` builds the backend with `--no-default-features --features standalone` and then builds the Qt host. `make app-run` performs that build and launches the host from source resources. These targets require Rust, CMake 3.21 or newer, and Qt 6.5 or newer; the Linux host also needs Qt DBus.

## Stable API and old plugins

`backend-version` belongs to the installed plugin revision. A plugin that has not
been updated continues using that exact private binary, even after main and newer
plugins move on. Neither the app nor Install CLI selects a global or latest backend.
Install CLI only links to the plugin's own executable. Old release tags, binaries,
checksums and API contract assets must remain available and immutable: an old
plugin must also be able to reinstall its pinned version years later. This preserves
the plugin/backend pairing; it cannot guarantee that external mail providers will
never change their services.

There are three independent versions: the plugin manifest version, the exact
backend binary release in `backend-version`, and the integer API revision in
`backend-api.json`. JSON-RPC framing has its own `protocolVersion`. Internal Rust
fixes or optimizations can merge without changing the binary pin or API revision;
users receive those fixes when a later backend release is explicitly pinned.
QML presentation changes can likewise reuse the existing backend.

The contract records the public method inventory and representative request/response
fixtures. Changes to methods, accepted parameters, returned fields, errors or their
meaning require contract review, updated fixtures and a higher API revision.
`system.info.apiVersion` states the API revision. The initial published binary 0.9.0
predates this field; only that exact version is recognized as legacy API 1. Missing
revision information from any other version is refused.

## Released and unreleased: one step ahead of the pin

Backends ship in batches, not per merge, so `main` may implement an API the pinned
binary does not have yet. The contract names that difference and nothing more:

- `releasedApiVersion` is the API the pinned, published binary speaks; the runtime
  handshake accepts exactly that. `apiVersion` is what this checkout's Rust
  implements, equal to it or **one step ahead** — a second step is refused by
  `check-api` until the first is released, which is what makes releases batches.
- `unreleased.methods` and `unreleased.cases` name what the step adds: methods
  only the step has, and contract cases only a binary from this checkout passes.
  A case on an unreleased method is itself unreleased. With `apiVersion` equal to
  `releasedApiVersion` both lists are empty.
- CI runs two gates on every revision, and the required check needs both. The
  **Released backend gate** downloads the pinned release and checks that its
  contract equals the checkout's released view (`check-api --published`), then
  runs the released view of the fixtures against that binary
  (`test_backend_api.py --released`). The **Unreleased API gate** builds the
  backend from the revision and runs the whole contract and the native agent
  bridge against it. A merge into `main` can therefore carry an unreleased step
  and still leave every fresh install working. A failed gate leaves a note,
  and `ci-report.yml` — run after CI, with the one write permission the CI run
  of a fork cannot have — posts it on the PR as a comment saying which gate
  failed and what to do, updating the same comment on every push.
- The plugin's runtime status reports `latestApiVersion` and `unreleasedMethods`
  beside the required revision. `Backend` exposes `needsUpdate` when the
  connected binary lacks the step, and refuses a call to an unreleased method on
  it with `backend_needs_update` (code -32012) — so a feature that forgot to
  look before asking fails the way it already handles, never as a request the old
  binary would misread. `Service.backendNeedsUpdate` is an overall update indicator, not a per-feature gate. A feature checks the connected backend against the fixed API revision that introduced it: event suggestions use `Service.backendCanSuggestEvents`, true only for a ready backend with API 2 or newer. That requirement remains correct before release, after the pin advances, and when a later unrelated API is introduced.
- `tests/test_source.sh` permits calls only to declared backend methods. QML regression tests exercise fixed feature requirements across connected API versions and changing release metadata; a release must not require deleting compatibility checks from QML.
- The pin commit made by a release folds the step: `releasedApiVersion` becomes
  `apiVersion`, both `unreleased` lists empty. Published contracts from before
  the split are read as all released.

## Release before pin

Run `make publish VERSION=MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` on a clean main synchronized with origin. Without `VERSION`, it prepares the next patch version. The command creates `release/X.Y.Z`, prepares Cargo.toml, the omamail Cargo.lock record and manifest.json, and opens one PR targeting main. It pushes only that release branch, then follows its exact Release run. It never pushes main or a tag. `backend-version` and the released API contract stay unchanged during preparation.

A push to `release/**` starts the authoritative Release workflow. Only the exact `release/X.Y.Z` branch matching Cargo's version is accepted; dispatching on main, a feature branch or a tag is refused. The workflow builds both plugin backends and all three standalone archives, creates `vX.Y.Z`, publishes the complete asset set and installers, verifies the public downloads, then commits `backend-version` and the folded API contract on the same release branch. The pin commit changes only those two files, both excluded from the publication push trigger, so it starts PR checks without another publication.

The required **Published backend merge gate** refuses a release PR until its pin equals the prepared version, then verifies the actual released binaries and contract as usual. Once the pin commit and required checks pass, review and merge that PR once: main receives the version metadata and working backend dependency together. The command does not merge automatically. Features wait until the connected backend meets their fixed minimum API revision, independently of whether that revision is currently labelled released or unreleased.

The repository's active main ruleset requires a PR and the Published backend merge gate and prohibits deletion and force pushes. Administrators currently have a pull-request-only bypass: direct pushes remain blocked, but an administrator can explicitly bypass checks when merging a PR. Never enable an always-on bypass or use the PR bypass for routine releases; neither a local push nor CI should advance main directly.

The workflow tests and builds locked native musl binaries on Linux x86_64 and
aarch64, executes each version probe, rejects dynamic ELF dependencies, and
packages `omamail-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and `omamail-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`. Each
contains exactly one regular executable named `omamail`. A combined SHA256SUMS
and `backend-build.json` plus `backend-api.json` are published with both assets only
after both build jobs pass. The release checks the new contract against the pinned
release: a changed contract requires a higher API revision. Each native binary
must also pass the contract runner before packaging.
Both native build jobs produce identical source fingerprints before publication. The new draft
release is completed, made public, downloaded again and verified before a
follow-up commit updates backend-version and folds backend-api.json on the release branch.

The same workflow builds `omamail-app-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` on macOS 15, `omamail-app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` on Ubuntu 22.04 (the glibc 2.35 floor), and `omamail-app-windows-x86_64.zip` on Windows Server 2022. Each native job runs the standalone Rust suite, its platform credential contract, the Qt C++ tests, the standalone QML suite, the backend API contract, package validation, installer rollback tests, resource checks, and a live bundled-backend smoke test before uploading its archive. `publish-and-pin` depends on all five build jobs, creates one combined `SHA256SUMS`, publishes `install.sh` and `install.ps1` with the archives, downloads every public asset again, and only then advances the plugin backend pin.

The Linux standalone release is tar.gz only; no AppImage is built or published. Standalone archives are currently unsigned. The macOS app is not notarized, so `install.sh` clears `com.apple.quarantine` recursively from the exact verified staging bundle before the transactional replacement; an `xattr` failure aborts without replacing an existing install. The Windows binaries are not code signed, so its platform publisher warning remains a release limitation rather than a property the validation jobs can clear.

Publication is serialized. Existing releases and tags are never overwritten;
remote lookup errors fail closed. The branch must still equal the dispatch
revision before publication and before the pin commit. A normal fast-forward
push rejects concurrent movement; there is no force push or branch-protection
bypass. If publication succeeds but the branch moves or rejects the pin push,
the release remains published and the pin stays unchanged. Inspect that failure
and verify the already-published assets before preparing a reviewed pin-only change on the same release PR; rerunning publication refuses the existing version. If the branch push succeeded but PR creation failed, open the PR for that existing branch instead of invoking publish again. If tag creation succeeded but publication failed, inspect the retained tag and any draft; never delete or reuse a published version. Prepare a new release version when the existing attempt cannot be safely completed.

Repository setup must provide `RELEASE_TOKEN`, an appropriately scoped GitHub App token or fine-grained token with contents write permission for this repo, permitted to push release branches and create tags and releases. Local `gh` needs permission to push the branch and open its PR. The default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot be used for the pin push because it suppresses subsequent workflow triggers. See [GitHub's workflow triggering rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow). Release runs only on versioned release branches, by push or explicit dispatch; restrict who can push these trusted branches and tags. PR CI has read-only permissions and never
receives that secret. Require **Published backend merge gate** in branch
protection. That check reads the plugin's exact pin independently of Cargo's
current development version, verifies both published native archives, compares the
published API contract with the PR's contract, and runs `tests/test_backend_api.py`
against each actual published binary using the PR's production QML Wire/Chunks
codecs. It also checks that Rust's public method inventory matches the contract.
A PR cannot satisfy this check merely by building a newer local executable.

Source fingerprints in `backend-build.json` remain release provenance. They bind
both release builds to the same Rust sources, resources and build inputs; they do
not require future PRs to contain identical Rust source. Cargo and Cargo.lock must
still agree for builds, but their development version need not equal the pinned
published binary.

For a combined QML/Rust PR requiring an API change: raise `apiVersion` one step
past `releasedApiVersion`, name the new methods and cases under `unreleased`, and
let the feature wait until the connected backend reaches that feature's fixed minimum API revision. Both gates run on the PR and
it merges into `main` without a release; the next release from `main` publishes
the binary and its pin commit folds the step. Runtime handshake still requires the
exact plugin-local binary pin, even when a newer release reports the same API; at
that version it accepts the released API or the one unreleased step, so a local
build of the checkout (`make install`) runs the step in the desktop while the
published binary of the same version keeps working without it.

The contract runner exercises the contract's cases and checks the advertised
inventory — the released view against the pinned binary, everything against a
binary built from the checkout. It covers representative mail processing and cached reader behavior,
not every provider operation or every possible QML argument. API reviewers must
extend fixtures for newly used behavior; passing these tests is not a proof of
complete semantic compatibility. Contract fixtures, API revisions, workflows and
repository policy changes require trusted review. These scripts do not change
repository settings.

Bootstrap status: v0.9.0 contains the optimized x86_64 and aarch64 static
backends. The published packages were checked against the successful native CI
artifacts from f38c2ac; its source fingerprint was added and downloaded again
before advancing the pin. v0.8.2 remains unchanged. The first CI publication
attempt failed because RELEASE_TOKEN lacked permission to create a release;
the release was completed separately. Future automated publication still requires
a contents-write token as described above.

## Standalone security gates

A standalone release needs a separate security verdict for macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, and Windows x64. The verdict is **PASS** only when the release commit has completed its native job and every boundary below was exercised on that runtime. A shared test on another operating system, successful compilation, or source inspection alone leaves that platform **NOT VERIFIED**. A failing boundary is **BLOCK** and prevents publication.

| Boundary | Evidence required on each native runtime |
| --- | --- |
| Credentials | Native Keychain, Secret Service, or Credential Manager success, missing-item, denial, validation, and bounded-prompt cases; secrets absent from argv, settings, and diagnostics. |
| Untrusted mail and URLs | Plain-text metadata, HTML/resource sanitization, public-address DNS pinning, HTTPS/TLS, redirect, proxy, deadline, and response-size cases using controlled targets. |
| Process argv and stdin | Hostile arguments preserved as one argument, exact stdin bytes including NUL, bounded stdout/stderr, timeout, cancellation, and descendant termination. |
| Private files and outbox IPC | Platform directory resolution, unsafe ancestor/link/reparse refusal, ownership and ACL checks, atomic replacement/rollback, locks, peer identity, and oversized IPC frames. |
| Archive installation | SHA-256 verification before extraction, strict single-root layout and architecture/version checks, traversal/link/special-file and size refusal, transactional upgrade rollback, and uninstall preserving user data. |
| Notifications | Plain-text or escaped markup handling, NUL refusal, bounded private activation routes, stale/forged route refusal, cold and warm activation, and no secret or route token in process arguments. |
| Network requests | Every mail/calendar request keeps credentials on the configured origin or validated public target, validates bytes before process start, applies TLS/protocol/redirect/proxy policy, and has a deadline and response bound. |

The native standalone job runs this platform gate before its archive can become an artifact. It must run `cargo test --locked --no-default-features --features standalone`, the ignored native credential contract, CTest, the standalone QML tests, package and installer tests, `--check-resources`, `--smoke-test`, and the packaged backend API contract. The release's `publish-and-pin` job depends on all three platform jobs; missing or failed native evidence cannot be replaced by manually uploading an archive.

Current integrated-checkout audit on 2026-09-14: macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, and Windows x64 are **NOT VERIFIED** until the corresponding `release/**` native jobs complete for this exact commit. Local macOS results may establish part of the boundary evidence, but they do not exercise Linux Secret Service/DBus, Windows Credential Manager/named pipes/ACLs, or clean hosted-runner install and notification activation on those systems. Do not treat this documentation commit or the presence of workflow definitions as a hosted-runner result.

## Local verification

For the standalone host, run `make app-build` to build without the AI feature and `make app-run` to launch from source resources. `make test-app-qml` builds the host and runs its composition test. A fuller local native check is:

```sh
cargo test --locked --no-default-features --features standalone
cmake -S app -B build/app -DOMAMAIL_BACKEND="$PWD/target/debug/omamail"
cmake --build build/app --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/app --output-on-failure
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen qmltestrunner -input app/tests/qml/tst_host_contract.qml -import app/qml/imports -import ui
```

These commands establish evidence only for the operating system that ran them. Package and installer acceptance must use the archive produced on its native release runner; macOS and Linux use `app/scripts/package-release.sh`, while Windows uses `app/scripts/package-release.ps1`.

`make install-plugin` removes the old private backend and its local-build marker,
then links and reloads only the plugin. It does not compile or download a backend.
Accounts, drafts and caches are preserved. Use it to test a fresh backend setup:

```sh
make install-plugin
```

Then open Omamail and choose Install backend. Any optional CLI symlink still points
to the same private binary location and works again after installation. Ensure the
shell has no `OMAMAIL_BIN` development override, which would otherwise select that
binary instead of testing the missing-runtime screen.

To try the latest checkout in the desktop, run `make install`. It first builds
with `cargo build --locked --release` into this checkout's `target/` directory,
regardless of `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, then stages and verifies that binary before
atomically replacing `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/omamail/bin/omamail`. When its version is ahead of the
release pin, it must match the Git checkout's Cargo package version. The explicit
local installation records a private
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/omamail/local-build.json` marker binding
that version, the current release pin and the installed binary's SHA-256.
Status and CLI activation accept this local version only while the checkout,
Cargo version, pin and binary bytes still match. No tracked pin is changed.
Only after
that succeeds does it link the plugin and restart the shell. It does not need
published backend assets. Failed builds or version checks preserve the old runtime.

`make install-backend-local` performs only the build and local runtime replacement.
Restart the shell afterwards to replace an already running backend process.
Unset `OMAMAIL_BIN` in the shell's startup environment to use the private runtime.
The separate `scripts/install-backend.sh` command remains the release downloader:
it always uses `backend-version`, ignores the local override when selecting a
release, and clears the marker after verification as part of installation.
Uninstall also removes the marker. Local version overrides require Python 3.11
or newer for Cargo TOML parsing; normal pinned installations do not.

Run `make test-local` on a machine with Rust, Qt 6 test tooling and Quickshell.
It runs the existing Rust, JavaScript, transport/security and offscreen QML
suites, then `make test-backend-process` builds the development executable and
tests the production QML bridge against it using real Quickshell pipes.
The integration test uses temporary HOME/XDG directories and synthetic account
settings. It checks version/protocol handshake, concurrent request correlation,
error responses, credential-free account summaries, a binary message larger
than 1 MiB through upload and response chunks, and confirmed process shutdown.
It does not open the desktop plugin or contact mail providers.

`make test-backend-process` can also be run on its own. These local checks do
not verify live mailbox compatibility, graphical plugin installation, or release
availability. `make qml-check` additionally needs the installed Omarchy shell's
QML imports; inspect its diagnostics even when qmllint returns success.

Local synthetic tests cover archive shape, checksum corruption, version drift,
preparation without pin advancement, pin-only commits and moved-branch refusal.
Historical pre-release checks: a native aarch64 Debian Bookworm container with Rust 1.100.0-nightly
(2026-09-03) passed locked musl tests and a release build; its version probe
returned 0.8.2 and ELF inspection found no interpreter or dynamic section.
The local x86_64 musl test process crashed under Docker emulation. Subsequent
v0.9.0 native Actions builds and published-asset verification supersede that
architecture gap, as recorded above. Future releases still require their own
hosted checks; passing local tests alone is not release availability.
