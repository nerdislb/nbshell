# 5. Nothing tracked may be large. This plugin is installed by cloning it, so
#    every megabyte in the tree is a megabyte between the user and a working
#    mailbox — and the things that get big are never the source. A published
#    design canvas with the editor bundled into it was 805 KB of the 1.4 MB a
#    clone cost, for content that was already in the repo beside it as six
#    small files, and an unreferenced screenshot was another 320 KB.
#
#    Anything genuinely large belongs somewhere a clone does not have to carry:
#    a release asset, or GitHub's own attachment host, which is where the
#    README's screenshots already live.
#
#    preview.png is the one exception, and it is named rather than waved
#    through by raising the ceiling. The marketplace catalog rebuilds from
#    branch HEAD and takes a plugin's card image from a root file, so this one
#    has to be in the tree or the card falls back to a placeholder. It gets a
#    ceiling of its own instead of none: a card image that grew to a megabyte
#    would still be a megabyte every user clones.
